            <p id="pp1">The writing process is defined as the steps taken to produce a strong written
                work, though these steps do not have to be chronological. These steps can include
                research, notes, prewriting, drafting, peer revision, and reflection. This goal was also
                met by all three essay assignments. I began by analyzing the written works of others
                and writing notes on them. Then, I used those notes to form an argument and a thesis.
                The next step was a prewriting assignment followed by a first draft. After the first draft
                was complete, I participated in peer review sessions and consultations with my
                professor. After some personal reflection, I reworked my draft according to their
                suggestions and my new ideas. Then, I repeated the review and drafting steps until I got
                to the final product. The writing process helps me produce stronger work because it
                requires me to constantly re-evaluate what I am doing. The steps give me multiple
                opportunities to fix mistakes and clean up my argument. If I tried to turn in my first draft
                as my final draft, I would lose out on those opportunities to rethink my work. The writing
                process is something I thoroughly enjoy about writing, and the only way to learn it is to
                practice it</p>
